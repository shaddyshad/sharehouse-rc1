# Sharehouse clean project tree structure
After deleting the old polluted sharehouse environment, I divided the project into both the front and the backend, which are all now in different repository. The current repository is the backend, containing business logic code, written in express JS.    
I have been thinking about doing it in django, since am lil bit more familiar than express, but it is going to be a good learning experience.
